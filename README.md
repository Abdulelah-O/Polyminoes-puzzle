# Polyominoes Puzzle Solver

## Project Overview

This project is an efficient solver for a version of the classic Polyominoes Puzzle. ***The goal is to find a collection of tiles (subsets) that completely covers a given board (set X) without any overlapping. This is a classic Exact Cover Problem, a well-known NP-complete problem that is often solved using metaheuristics.***
